# Project Description
Many travel apps choose to focus on large, obvious attractions and towns already known to most people.  Ventana focuses on the in-between and off-beat places unknown to most travellers. 

Ventana is a travel app for those seeking an off-beat adventure that's off the beaten path.  When a user visits Ventana, they can select from a number of small-town attractions across the United States categorized by region.  Each town/attraction has a description page helping the user make their decision.  Once the user decides to visit a location, they are able to place it their collection called 'My Places', which creates a list of all the places the user has chosen.  

 # Libraries, frameworks, etc. required for app to work properly.
